    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>

    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 10 February 2026</p>

    <p>
      These Terms of Use govern your access to and use of the Momento application
      ("Momento", "we", "us", or "the App"). By accessing or using the App, you agree
      to be bound by these Terms of Use. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose of the App</h2>
    <p>
      Momento is a countdown tracker and widget app that helps you create and manage
      personal countdowns. The App is provided for personal, non-commercial use.
    </p>

    <h2>Account and Data</h2>
    <p>
      Momento does not require an account. Countdown data is stored locally on your
      device. You are responsible for maintaining your own backups if needed.
    </p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>
      Momento may offer a one-time purchase to unlock premium features. Purchases are
      processed by Apple and managed by RevenueCat. All sales are final except as
      required by applicable law and Apple App Store policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Availability and Changes</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the App (or any part of it)
      at any time, with or without notice.
    </p>

    <p>
      These Terms of Use may be updated periodically. Continued use of the App after
      changes are published constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, Momento and its operators shall not be
      liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages
      arising out of or related to your use of, or inability to use, the App.
    </p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with applicable laws,
      without regard to conflict of law principles.
