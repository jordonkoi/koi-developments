    <p>
      WalkMor provides general fitness and wellness information for walking and
      daily movement. It is not medical advice and is not a substitute for
      professional care.
    </p>

    <h2>Not Medical Advice</h2>
    <p>
      The App does not provide medical, clinical, or emergency services. Always seek
      the advice of a qualified healthcare professional with any questions you may
      have regarding a medical condition or health goals.
    </p>

    <h2>Not for Emergencies</h2>
    <p>
      If you think you may have a medical emergency, call emergency services
      immediately.
    </p>

    <h2>Use at Your Own Risk</h2>
    <p>
      Physical activity involves inherent risks. You are responsible for your own
      health and safety when using the App. Stop activity and seek medical care if
      you experience pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, or other concerning
      symptoms.
    </p>

    <h2>No Doctor-Patient Relationship</h2>
    <p>
      Use of the App does not create a doctor-patient or clinician-patient relationship
      between you and WalkMor, its operators, or contributors.
    </p>

    <h2>Accuracy and Availability</h2>
    <p>
      We strive to provide accurate information, but we do not guarantee that content
      is complete, accurate, or up to date. The App may be modified or discontinued
      at any time.
